# COVID-19 Dashboard

This COVID-19 tracking dashboard website pulls up-to-date covid-19 information via 3rd party APIs, then presents the data in a cohesive, simple dashboard. Data is segmented into a few categories: Statistical Data, Historical Graph, Interactive map, and Latest News. The app gives users a high-level assessment of the state of covid-19 containment in their area, allowing users to make informed decisions. The webpage is responsive & each section tells users the timing for each piece of data.

## Directions for Future Development:

For future development we would like to add government data, add possibly Twitter announcements from the selected state’s Governor, and make it have a customizable dashboard. The customizable dashboard would give the user the option to select whether they want to select from only seeing news, statistics or other specific information on their screen. 

We would also make our tabs for “Mask Advisories”, “Social Distancing Requirements”, “Travel Restrictions Info” and “Trend in New Cases” actually display the data for the particular selected state within the tabs, instead of being a link for the user. 

Finally, we would like to be able to pull the user’s location to automatically let the user know about any Covid-19 related alerts and spikes in their area, and be able to have world information and statistics as an option on the index and dashboard pages.
