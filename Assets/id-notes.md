# Notes for IDs
*These are the JS hooks in index.html. They are inside standard jQuery notation for easy copy & pasting.*

---
#### NavBar
[**NavBar No Longer has a SearchBar!**]
* Each top menu button now has a data attribute: `data-location-name`. The data attribute corresponds to the name of the state, or "Country" / "World" (for the Country & World Buttons).
* Each state menu button now has a class: `$(".selector-dropdown")`. The top level menu itmes each have a unique class, with `-world`, `-country`, and `-states` added to the `.selector-dropdown` class.
* Each state has another data attribute: `data-state-abbr`. The data attribute corresponds to the abbreviation of the state name, in lowercase. World & Country do not have this data attribute.

#### Top Alerts
* Mask Advisory Cell (to toggle cell display if no information): `$("#maskAdvisoryCell")`
* Mask Advisory Alert Span: `$("#maskAdvisorySpan")`
* Social Distancing Cell (to toggle cell display if no information): `$("#socialDistancingCell")`
* Social Distancing Advisory Alert Span: `$("#socialDistancingSpan")`
* Travel Restrictions Cell (to toggle cell display if no information): `$("#travelRestrictionsCell")`
* Travel Restrictions Alert Span: `$("#travelRestrictionsSpan")`
* New Cases Trend Cell (to toggle cell display if no information): `$("#newCasesTrendCell")`
* New Cases Trend Alert Span: `$("#newCasesTrendSpan")`

#### Stats Sidebar
* Updated Stats Date Span (to let user know how recent data is): `($"#updatedStatsDateSpan")`
* Confirmed Total Cases Span: `($"#todayTotPositiveSpan")` *(Same as Cumulative Positive Tests)*
* Daily New Cases Span: `($"#todayIncPositiveSpan")`
* Confirmed Total Deaths Span: `($"#todayTotDeathsSpan")`
* Daily New Deaths Span: `($"#todayDailyDeathsSpan")`

* Cumulative Positive Tests: `$("#todayTotPositiveSpan")` *(Same as Confirmed Total Cases)*
* Cumulative Negative Tests: `$("#todayTotNegativeSpan")`
* Cumulative Total Tests: `$("#todayTotTestsSpan")`
* Increase in Testing: `$("#todayIncTestsSpan")`

* Current Hospitalized Population Span: `($"#todayCurrHospitalSpan")`
* Increase in Hospitalizations: `($"#todayIncHospitalSpan")`
* Total Cumulative Hospitalizations: `($"#todayTotHospitalSpan")`

#### Map Area
* Map Display Area: `$("#mapDisplayArea")`
* The map area has a placeholder image, inside of the div labeled `#mapDisplayArea`. It is described by the following code:
```
<div class="media-object stack-for-small" id="mapPlaceholder">
    <div class="media-object-section">
        <img src="https://github.com/ShepLT1/covid-tracker/blob/master/Assets/Images/map-example.jpg?raw=true"
        width="100%" alt="Map">
    </div>
</div>
```
Note that the placeholder div has the ID `$("#mapPlaceholder")`, so if the map fails to load, we could use this as a backup.

#### Gov Announcements (Tweets)
* I don't know the format that embedded tweets will take. For now, There are ID hooks for the whole area (to dynamically generate cards?) and for each of the three cards (to fill each card?).
* Gov Announcements Area: `$("#govAnnouncementsArea")`
* Gov Announcements Card 1: `$("#announcementCard1")`
* Gov Announcements Card 2: `$("#announcementCard2")`
* Gov Announcements Card 3: `$("#announcementCard3")`

#### Latest News
* I also don't know the format for latest news, so I will include both the whole column and each card, like I did for the government section.
* Latest News Area: `$("#newsArea")`
* News Card 1: `$("#newsCard1")`
* News Card 2: `$("#newsCard2")`
* News Card 3: `$("#newsCard3")`

#### Links List
* In case we want to dynamically adjust the links list.
* `<ul>` Links List: `$("#linksList")`
